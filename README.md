## üîç System Requirements

- Windows 11 (64-bit)
- .NET 6.0 or later
- Administrator privileges (for modifying system settings)
- 4GB RAM minimum
- 50MB of free disk space

## üì• Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/PrimeBuild-pc/ThreadPilot/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
3. Launch ThreadPilot from your Start menu
4. Grant administrator privileges when prompted

## üîÑ How It Works

ThreadPilot integrates with Windows' built-in power management and process scheduling capabilities, providing a user-friendly interface to access and control these features. It uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and PowerCfg utilities to modify system settings safely and effectively.

### Power Profiles

Power profiles (.pow files) contain configurations for Windows power management settings. ThreadPilot allows you to:

- Import existing .pow files
- Create custom profiles tailored to your needs
- Export and share your optimized configurations
- Switch between profiles with a single click

### Process Management

The application monitors running processes and allows you to:

- Set processor affinity (which cores a process can use)
- Adjust process priorities
- Create persistent rules for applications

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

ThreadPilot operates entirely on your local system and does not:
- Collect or transmit any personal data
- Require internet connectivity to function
- Install any third-party software or services
